    <h1>Welcome to Hisab.io</h1>
    
    <p> Manage your shared expenses with ease.</p>
    
    <p>
        After a trip or an event with a group of friends or family, we often spend lot of time sorting out <i>who owe who</i> and <i>how much</i>? 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Hisab will take the pain away by allowing you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Create an <i>event</i></li>
            <li>Add and invite friends to join</li>
            <li>Add common or non-common expenses using various ways to split an expense</li>
            <li>Track your share </li>
            <li>Settlement feature allows you to track <i>how much you owe</i> and <i>who owe you</i> </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
